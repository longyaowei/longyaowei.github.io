I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan and I am very fortunate to be advised by [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/). I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, especially in graph algorithms and data structures. <br/>
Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. During the spring and summer of 2020, I also made a wonderful research visit at UMich, advised by [Seth Pettie](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pettie/). <br/>
In the fall of 2023, I was a visiting student at the Simons Institute for the [Data Structures and Optimization for Fast Algorithms](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/data-structures-optimization-fast-algorithms) program.
